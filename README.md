# Mock microservice

## TODO

- [ ] Organize middleware and maybe server
- [ ] Testing infrastructure, use Testcontainers?
- [ ] Create github actions for validating code gen. (Need to solve: How do we handle depandabot's PRs?)
- [ ] Create auth gRPC middleware.
- [ ] Update documentation on packages.
